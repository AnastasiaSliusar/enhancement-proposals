✨Proposing a new JEP?✨

Make sure that you have at least done the following:

1. **Create a GitHub issue**  in the Jupyter Enhancement Proposals repo that
 1. Briefly outlines the proposal
 2. Suggests a review team (optional)
 3. Declares why it should be a JEP (See the “JEP / Not-a-JEP Rubric” below.)
2. **Identify a Shepherd** to see the process through. (Shepherds are assigned
   on a round-robin basis from a set of interested engaged volunteers).
3. **Decide if it's a JEP** according to the criteria listed above. The Shepherd decides if the JEP criteria have been met.
4. **Used the new JEP markdown template** to help structure your thoughts. You can find it in `jupyter-enhancement-proposal-guidelines/TEMPLATE.md` in this repository.
